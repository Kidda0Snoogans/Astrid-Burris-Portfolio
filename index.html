                This is my best friend Rowan, we've known each other since 6th grade. We became friends because we had to sit together on a field trip bus and I was scared of the escalator we had to go up so they helped me.

                Fight club has to be my all time favorite movie. My first time watching it was with my sis and my father.

                Moral Orel is my all time favorite show. It ran so shows like Bojack Horseman could walk. It still really upsets me that Adult swim canceled the show.
