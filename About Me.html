                I was born at Bloomington Hospital on April second of 2008. I was supposed to be born the first, but I managed to stick around and was born early on the second. As a young child, my parents had to split up. My mum decided to move up to Michigan and my dad stayed here in Bloomington. After a, roughly, three year custody battle I ended up in Greene county with my dad and stepmom. Unfortunately, in first grade, my mom died. As a kiddo, I adored school. I was an overachiever, still am, but had no clue what I was going to do after school. I was also considered a 'tomboy' by my family because I hated the idea of anything stereotypically 'girly'. I loved videogames and pretty much anything my dad liked.

                    In fith grade, my step mum moved out. That left just my father and I, so I ended up doing all the cooking. Before sixth grade started, everyone in my grade had to try out instruments. I was really into the Simpsons, especially Lisa, so I really wanted to play the sax. I tried it and realized that it would've been too heavy for me to carry to and from school every day. So, my first choice ended up being viola because violin was too 'overpopular' to my sixth grade brain. After a year of Viola, I hated it. My hand just would not grip the bow properly, and I didn't like how I had to hold it very much. Luckilly though, my crush was a bassist and I had been wanting to get closer to her. I ended up much prefering bass over viola, and Freshman year, I learned about the joys of German bows. In my eighth grade summer, my dad dropped a massive bomb on me. I have an 18 year old sister. She ended up being really cool and is probably the reason I'm still alive.

                    For me, Freshman year was an eye opener for me. I learned fairly quickly not to trust someone just because you've known them for forever. It was a little bit of a challenge learning who I could fully trust and who I couldn't. Halfway through my sophmore year, a buddy of mine told me about the Catapult program. I was intrested, so went to the meeting that took place in Shreve Hall (Ivy Tech). That meeting intrigued me, so I kept at the application process and somehow managed to be accepted. There I was given the opportunity to learn the basics of website development and a wonderful networking opportunity.
